1. Project Name: “Novel Acquisition and Reconstruction Strategies to Accelerate Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Compressed Sensing”

Funding Agency: Department of Science and Technology (DST) under Technology Systems Development (TSD) Programme
Role: Co- Principal Investigator
Grant Received: INR 74,00,000/-
The objectives of this proposal
▪ Acceleration of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
▪ Advancement of research in magnetic resonance imaging technologies in academic settings in India.
▪ Acquisition strategies for region of interest compressed sensing.
▪ Optimal reconstruction strategies for combination of compressed sensing and parallel imaging.

2. Project Name: “Vision Based Way Point Navigation for Unmanned Vehicles”

Funding Agency: Defense Research & Development Organization (DRDO), Ministry of Defense, Govt. of India, India
Role: Principal Investigator
Grant Received: INR 15,00,000/-
This research grant involves the development of an image processing methodology to carry out
the task of “Vision Based Way-point Navigation of UAV” to accomplish autonomous navigation of UAV. 


3. Project Name: “Developing Technology for Communication between Blind and Deaf”.

Funding Agency: All India Council For Technical Education, New Delhi, India
Role: Principal Investigator
Grant Received: INR 5,80,000/-
This proposal is to develop a communication interface between blind and deaf. A deaf person uses sign language to communicate and a blind person uses speech. Since there is no common mode of communication between the two groups, we are making an attempt to develop an algorithm which acts as an interface between the two groups. This project helps them to interact with each other and improve their lives and to enable them to contribute to our society on par with normal citizens.


Research Interests

UAV and Medical Image Processing:
 To develop novel Image Processing algorithms for navigation of Unmanned Air  Vehicles (UAV) and Medical Image Processing.
 
▪ Sign Language Recognition: Developing a communication interface between blind and deaf. A deaf person uses sign language to communicate and a blind person uses speech. Since there is no common mode of communication between the two groups, we are making an attempt to develop an algorithm which acts as an interface between the two groups. This project helps them to interact with each other and improve their lives and to enable them to contribute to our society on par with normal citizens.

▪ Fingerprint Recognition: The approach uses minutiae detection in fingerprint images, binary detection and direct grayscale detection. Feature extraction includes the determination of local features like ridge ending, ridge bifurcation and global features like core point, delta point etc. Matching is done by comparing template data of the
image previously stored with calculated data of input image. Less number of minutiae is sufficient for matching and the whole process of preprocessing, feature extraction and matching takes 8-15 seconds.
▪ Classification of Kannada Characters- A South Indian Language: The approach makes use of extracting a graph out of each character for classification. The proposed method makes use of closed regions and junction points for constructing graph for each character. The classification is independent of the font and size of the printed text and
the system is seen to deliver reasonable performance.

▪ Developed the following algorithms for a variety of applications - Designed Robot for object tracking: “JUNIOR” Robot was developed to track the objects. - Degraded Character Recognition - Object Recognition.
